# Welcome to Springfield!

At Springfield, a fictional "Any Town", citizens come together to govern themselves using decentralized tools.

The decentralized governance system must meet these 3 keys criteria:

* 1. ease-of-use for high rate of citizens' participation

citizens can participate right away through the embedded wallet, **Silk**. On-boarding frictions are very much reduced.

* 2. privacy and anonymity to protect citizens' identities while safeguarding integrity of the governance

zero-knowledge credentials powered by **Zeronym** are used to ensure residency in Springfield anonymously and single unique participation

* 3. censorship and oppression resistant to ensure non-interference from big powers

big powers hate when citizens wake up and take lead. the governance system of Springfield must run in a decentralized manner.
